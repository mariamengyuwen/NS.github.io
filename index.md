Bio
---

I am an Associate Professor (without tenure) at the [Department of Economics](http://economics.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University. I graduated from UC Berkeley with a PhD in Economics in 2014.

My research tries to bring insights from psychology to bear on topics in economics, particularly topics relevant to developing countries. Recent projects include studying how improving sleep affects the economic outcomes of workers in India, how the endowment effect influences consumer demand for collateralized loans in Kenya, how research findings affect the beliefs and policy choices of mayors in Brazil, and how mixing rich and poor students in schools in India affects social preferences and behaviors.

Together with Frank Schilbach and Heather Schofield, I help run the [Behavioral Development Lab](https://behavioraldevlab.org/index.html) in India. I am a Faculty Research Fellow at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), and a faculty affiliate at the The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (JPAL). From 2018 to 2020, I served as an Associate Editor at the Journal of Political Economy.

### [The Importance of Being Marginal: Gender Differences in Generosity](./pdf/GenderGenerosityAERPP2013Final.pdf)

(with Stefano DellaVigna, John List and Ulrike Malmendier)

_American Economic Review Papers and Proceedings, May 2013_

[Abstract (click to expand)](javascript:toggle(0)): Do men and women have different social preferences? Previous findings are contradictory. We provide a potential explanation using evidence from a field experiment. In a door-to-door solicitation, men and women are equally generous, but women become less generous when it becomes easy to avoid the solicitor. Our structural estimates of the social preference parameters suggest an explanation: women are more likely to be on the margin of giving, partly because of a less dispersed distribution of altruism. We find similar results for the willingness to complete an unpaid survey: women are more likely to be on the margin of participation.
