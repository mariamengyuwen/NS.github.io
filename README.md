## How to Edit Each Section

### Sidebar

Sidebar is controlled by the file `config.toml` and `/layouts/default.html`.

- `title` is the title of the website.
- `description` is the text displayed right under the title.
- `logo` is the filename of the picture. The file is placed in `content/`. For example, if `logo = "gr.jpg"` then the picture should be placed at `content/gr.jpg` (as it is now).

### Bio, Publications, Work in Progress

Those three sections are controlled by index.md. Markdown writing are referencing from markdown files in content folder.
